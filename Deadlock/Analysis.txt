Steps to take Thread Dump
1. Find the PID of running java process (javaw.exe) using Windows Task Manager.
2. Execute the command
	C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_74\bin>jstack 57232 
	
1. Here I am creating two runnable blocks block1 and block2.
2. These two blocks are accessing two objects A and B but in different order. 
3. When the program is executed the Thread-0 takes lock on the object A with address 0x000000076dbeb8b8 and goes to wait state after encountering Thread.sleep(1000).
4. Thread-1 takes lock on object B with the address 0x000000076dbecd48.
5. Now Thread-0 will try to acquire lock on object B but will wait as Thread-1 has already lock on object B.
	- waiting to lock <0x000000076dbecd48> (a garbageCollector.DeadLockTest$B)
	- locked <0x000000076dbeb8b8> (a garbageCollector.DeadLockTest$A)
6. Thread-1 will also try to acquire lock on object A but it has been locked by Thread-0.
	- waiting to lock <0x000000076dbeb8b8> (a garbageCollector.DeadLockTest$A)
	- locked <0x000000076dbecd48> (a garbageCollector.DeadLockTest$B)
